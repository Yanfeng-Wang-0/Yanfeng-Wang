This directory contains R code, data and results for Week

1. Florida.R
This code analyzes the annual mean temperature data from Key West, Florida, spanning 1901â€“2000. It calculates the observed correlation between the year and temperature, performs a permutation test to assess the statistical significance of the correlation, and visualizes the results in two PDF plots.

2. TreeHeight.R
This code calculates tree heights based on angles and distances provided in a dataset. It also defines a function to compute individual tree heights and saves the computed results to a CSV file.
