## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts, data, and results developed during Week 2 of the CMEE program. The scripts cover a variety of programming tasks such as file operations, data processing, debugging, control flow demonstrations, and sequence alignment.

---

## Directory Structure

- **`code/`**: Contains all Python script files (`.py`).  
- **`data/`**: Input files used by the scripts.  
- **`results/`**: Output files generated by the scripts.  
- **`sandbox/`**: A workspace for temporary testing and debugging of scripts. This directory is used for experimentation and may contain intermediate files or scratch work not intended for final results.  

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/CMEECoursework.git
  cd CMEECoursework
  ```

2. (Optional) Ensure all scripts have execution permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x code/*.py
  ```

3. Verify your system has the required tools and dependencies installed (see below).

---

## Dependencies

- **Python 3**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.  
- **Required Libraries**: Some scripts may require additional libraries such as `pickle`, which is included in the Python standard library. Ensure you have all the standard Python modules available.  

---

## Workflow

1. Place your input files in the `data/` directory.  
2. Run the desired script from the `code/` directory or the repository root.  
3. Output files will be saved in the `results/` directory (unless otherwise specified).  
4. Use the `sandbox/` directory for testing or debugging.  

### Example Workflow:
1. To filter oak species data from `TestOaksData.csv` and save the output to `JustOaksData.csv`:
  ```bash
  python code/oaks_debugme.py
  ```

2. To find the best DNA sequence alignment using sequence.csv:
  ```bash
  python code/python_align_seqs.py
  ```
