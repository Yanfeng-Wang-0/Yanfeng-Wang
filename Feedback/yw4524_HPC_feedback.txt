Marks for main questions
Q 0 :    3 / 3
Q 1 :    2.5 / 4    comments: The quantitative result was correct but the text answer didn't attempt to give any reason for why the all adults and spread cases are different, unfortunately beyond this the text answer actually mixed up the two cases describing the all adults and spread results the wrong way around and showing a lack of understanding
Q 2 :    2 / 3    comments: correct simulation but text is descriptive and still carries over the mistakes of the previous question
Q 3 :    10 / 10
Q 4 :    10 / 10
Q 5 :    6.5 / 8    comments: text answer only explains why for the population size part of the question - we also needed to see a 'why' for the difference between all adults and spread population across life stages. The text answer confuses biological factors which are real but not in the model (genetic drift) with factors that are real and in the model (environmental fluctuations).
Q 6 :    10 / 10
Q 7 :    2 / 2
Q 8 :    1 / 1
Q 9 :    1 / 1
Q 10 :    2 / 2
Q 11 :    2 / 2
Q 12 :    2 / 2
Q 13 :    2 / 2
Q 14 :    2 / 3    comments: text answer doesn't properly explain the reason for the decline just saying it's because of random extinctions isn't enough - needs to talk about lack of speciation to replace extinctions and why extinctions occur at all (random drift population sizes going to zero)
Q 15 :    3 / 3
Q 16 :    1 / 1
Q 17 :    1 / 1
Q 18 :    3 / 4    comments: descriptive and doesn't get into the reasons for the findings - otherwise excellent'
Q 19 :    3 / 3
Q 20 :    3 / 3
Q 21 :    2 / 2
Q 22 :    4 / 4
Q 23 :    6 / 6
Q 24 :    5 / 6    comments: ran for wrong speciation rate otherwise excellent
Q 25 :    10 / 10
Q 26 :    3 / 10    comments: the graphed result was incorrect (because of the data collation step not because of the simulations themselves) also the simulation parameters run were with a speciation rate of 0.1 instead of the speciation rate specifically assigned in class to each individual

Marks for text quality :  4.6 /8
Comments...
In question 1 unfortunately this text describes the results the wrong way around and doesn't get into explaining why these results occur - it doesn't show any underlying understanding of the system being simulated.
In question 2 descriptive only and with some mistakes as well
In question 5 this is a generally very good answer though a bit incomplete in terms of the why and with a small error in understanding as well (see comments to the question)
In question 6 excellent, clear and shows good understanding of what's going on
In question 14 good but could have gone further to show understanding more clearly
In question 18 needed to get more into the reasons for the findings
In question 22 excellent to mention dynamic equilibrium, some details not quite spot on though - e.g. depending 'more on' something when actually depending 'only on' is correct
 
Marks for graphics quality :  8.5 /10
Comments...
In question 1 excellent, only minor point is that axes are preferable to a grid
In question 2 
In question 5 same comments apply as for other graphs - attention to detail would have improved it e.g. removing '_' from labels and using a space instead
In question 6 excellent, if being picky I'd suggest remove the box from around the legend but that's all I can think of
In question 14 excellent, though axes preferred to a grid
In question 18 
In question 22 would have been nice to label octaves fully (1,2-3,4-7 etc.)
In question 26 well made but would be improved by full text to describe each octave
 
Marks for code quality :  6 /8
Comments...
well commented but some style errors particularly that the main.R file when sourced runs a lot of functions rather than just loading the functions into working memory as it was supposed to
 
Marks for challenge questions :  9.7 /14
Comments...
challenge question A, very good but something is wrong with the data because NA is coming up in the graph - a higher resolution graph would have been better
challenge question B, good attempt but the equilibrium time is a substantial overestimate. Graph could have been neater with axes no grid and maybe a line to show where equilibrium occurs
challenge question C, excellent, might be nice to change the x axis range
challenge question D, excellent, might be nice to change the x axis range
good start but the coalescence_simulation function doesn't give the correct answer and the main code didn't produce a result in reasonable time, not challengeE graph handed in, challenge question E, good start but the coalescence_simulation function doesn't give the correct answer and the main code didn't produce a result in reasonable time, not challengeE graph handed in
