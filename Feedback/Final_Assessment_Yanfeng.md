# Final Assessment for Yanfeng


### General Comments
- The repository structure was clear and logical. Directories for `data`, `code`, `results`, and `sandbox` were consistent across weeks.
- The inclusion of a `.gitignore` file was noted from Week 2 onwards, which prevented unnecessary files from being committed. However, earlier inclusion could have prevented a larger repository size.
- The `README.md` files were detailed and provided clear installation and usage instructions. They improved significantly by Week 3, with better organization and clarity.

### Week 1
- The shell scripts were correctly categorized and executed as expected.
- A minor issue was found with missing script-level comments and docstrings.
- The `README.md` lacked detailed examples for script usage, which could have been helpful for new users.

### Week 2
- There was a lack of docstrings in many functions / modules.
- Some scripts, like `oaks_debugme.py`, could benefit from more robust error handling for missing or malformed input files.
- A significant improvement in the workflow documentation within the `README.md`.
 - You could have formatted the output of certain scripts to be a little neater/organised/informative -- for example `lc1.py` is perfectly functional, but the output could have been improved (compare with my solution).

### Week 3
- The R scripts were well-organized, and most of them executed without errors.

### Week 4
- `Florida.R` and `Florida_Correlation.tex`:Minor improvements could be made in commenting and documenting statistical methods within the R code.
  - The script effectively analyzed temperature trends and produced meaningful visualizations.
  - Statistical methods were implemented correctly but lacked inline comments explaining the logic, especially for permutation analysis.
    - The LaTeX report was well-structured and adhered to scientific reporting standards.
  - The use of histograms and the clear explanation of results added significant value.
  - Improvement: include a broader discussion of implications.
  - Your statistical and biological/ecological interpretations could have been deeper / more insightful. The report's conclusion was somewhat short!
- Your Groupwork practicals were all in order, and your group did OK in collaborating  - have a look at my group-specific feedback (already pushed to the git repo).

## Git Practices
- Git commit messages were consistent and descriptive by Week 3, showing a clear improvement in best practices.
- Early commits included binary files, inflating the repository size unnecessarily. This was corrected in later weeks with better `.gitignore` usage.
- Contributions were consistent, and the iterative improvements across scripts were evident from the logs.

## Overall Assessment

Overall, a good job! 

You exhibited steady growth in technical skills, project management, and documentation throughout the coursework. 

Some of your scripts did retain errors. Try to be a little more vigilant in chasing down errors in future. Your commenting is very thorough, perhaps a little too much so, but this will fix itself as you gain more experience.

It was a tough set of weeks, but I believe your hard work in them has given you a great start towards further training, a quantitative masters dissertation, and ultimately a career in quantitative biology!
