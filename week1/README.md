## Overview

This repository contains shell scripts and associated files developed during Week 1 of the CMEE program. The scripts perform various file operations, including format conversion, file concatenation, and providing a boilerplate template for creating new scripts.  

---

## Directory Structure

- **`code/`**: Contains all script files (`.sh`).
- **`data/`**: Input files used by the scripts.
- **`results/`**: Output files generated by the scripts.
- **`sandbox/`**:  A workspace for temporary testing and debugging of scripts. This directory is used for experimentation and may contain intermediate files or scratch work not intended for final results.

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/CMEECoursework.git
  cd CMEECoursework
  ```

2. (Optional) Ensure all scripts have execution permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x code/*.sh
  ```

3. Verify your system has the required tools and dependencies installed (see below).

---

## Dependencies

- **Shell environment**: Scripts are written for a Bash-compatible shell. Ensure your system has a shell interpreter installed.  
- **Standard Linux/Unix utilities**: Commands like `sed`, `awk`, and `grep` are used in some scripts.  
- No external dependencies are required for these scripts.  

---

## Workflow

1. Place your input files in the `data/` directory.  
2. Run the desired script from the `code/` directory or the repository root.  
3. Output files will be saved in the `results/` directory (unless otherwise specified).  
4. Use the `sandbox/` directory for testing or debugging.  

### Example Workflow:
1. To convert all CSV files in the `data/` directory to space-separated files:
  ```bash
  bash code/csvtospace.sh data results
  ```

2. To concatenate two files:
  ```bash
  bash code/ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh data/file1.txt data/file2.txt results/combined.txt
  ```

## Scripts

### 1. **`boilerplate.sh`**

- **Description**:  
  A boilerplate script that serves as a template for creating new shell scripts. Includes common structure and comments to streamline script creation.

- **Usage**:  
  Copy the script to a new file and modify it as needed for your specific task.

---

### 2. **`ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh`**

- **Description**:  
  Merges the contents of two input files (`file_1` and `file_2`) into a specified output file (`output_file`).

- **Features**:  
  - Reads two files from the command line.  
  - Appends the content of the second file to the first and writes to the output file.  

- **Usage**:  
  ```bash
  bash ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh file_1 file_2 output_file
  ```

---

### 3. **`csvtospace.sh`**

- **Description**:  
  Processes all CSV files in a specified directory, converting them into space-separated values (SSV) files, and saves the output in a `results/` directory.

- **Features**:  
  - Automatically detects all `.csv` files in the input directory.  
  - Converts each file to SSV format.  
  - Saves converted files in the `results/` directory.  

- **Usage**:  
  ```bash
  bash csvtospace.sh input_directory results_directory
  ```

---

### 4. **`tabtocsv.sh`**

- **Description**:  
  Converts a tab-delimited text file into a comma-delimited CSV file.

- **Features**:  
  - Takes a single tab-delimited file as input.  
  - Produces a CSV file as output in the same directory.  

- **Usage**:  
  ```bash
  bash tabtocsv.sh input_file
  ```
